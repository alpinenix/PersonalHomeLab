## Overview

This repository documents my personal homelab infrastructure, configurations, and projects. Built with a focus on security best practices and enterprise-grade system administration, this homelab serves as both a testing ground for new technologies and a practical demonstration of my technical skills.

## Infrastructure

### Hardware
- **Server**: HP DL360P
- **Networking**: 10Gbps backbone connecting critical infrastructure

### Virtualization Layer
- **Hypervisor**: Proxmox VE8
- **Custom Network Segmentation**: VLAN implementation with security zones
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource management for optimal performance

## Security Implementations

- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated VLANs with controlled traffic flow between security domains
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Implemented principle of least privilege across all services
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Monitoring and alerting for suspicious network activities
- **Certificate Management**: Self-hosted PKI for secure internal communications
- **Secure Remote Access**: VPN solutions with multi-factor authentication

## Featured Projects

### Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) + Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
Implemented a comprehensive security monitoring solution using Wazuh (SIEM) and Shuffle (SOAR) to provide real-time threat detection, log analysis, and automated incident response. This system monitors all personal devices whether connected directly to the homelab network or accessing it via VPN, providing continuous security visibility and automated response capabilities.

### Private Cloud Infrastructure with OpenNebula
Built a virtualized cloud environment using OpenNebula deployed on multiple VMs, creating a practical implementation of cloud architecture principles. This project focused on applying Linux security hardening techniques and network security controls in a multi-tenant environment, effectively simulating enterprise-grade cloud security measures at scale.

## Documentation Structure

Each project in this repository will include:

- Detailed architecture diagrams
- Implementation guides
- Configuration files (with sensitive information redacted)
- Lessons learned and best practices

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Infrastructure Design**: Enterprise-grade network and system architecture
- **Security Hardening**: OS-level and application security implementations
- **Automation**: Infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring & Management**: Comprehensive observability solutions
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies and recovery procedures

## Future Roadmap

- **Network Traffic Analysis System**: Implement Zeek (formerly Bro) + ELK Stack for advanced network traffic analysis and visualization
- **Container Security Platform**: Deploy Kubernetes with security-focused tools like Falco, Trivy, and OPA Gatekeeper
- **Purple Team Environment**: Create an isolated pentesting lab with vulnerable systems and defensive monitoring
- **Zero Trust Access Control**: Implement a comprehensive identity-aware proxy using tools like Pomerium or Teleport

### Python Security Projects (Future Roadmap pt2)

- **Custom Security Dashboard**: Build a Python-based dashboard (Flask/Django) pulling data from SIEM/SOAR to create customized security visualizations
- **Automated Threat Intelligence**: Develop a Python script that collects, processes, and correlates threat intelligence feeds with internal logs
- **Network Security Monitor**: Create a Python-based tool using Scapy to detect anomalous network behaviors and potential lateral movement
- **Security Configuration Auditor**: Build a tool that automatically audits and reports on security configurations across infrastructure

## Contact & Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as documentation of personal projects, I welcome discussions about the implemented technologies and approaches. Feel free to open an issue for questions or suggestions.
